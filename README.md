## Project Overview
Our E-Commerce project aims to create an online shopping platform where users can browse products, view product categories, and add items to their cart. The frontend is built using React and interacts with the backend API to fetch and display data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
## Usage
### Home Page
The home page displays a list of products available for purchase. Users can view product details and add products to their cart.

### Product Category Page
The product category page lists different product categories. Users can click on a category to view products related to that category.

### Category Product Page
This page displays products within a specific category. Users can view product details and add products to their cart.

### User Registration Page
The user registration page allows new users to sign up for an account. Users can provide their name, email, password, phone number, address, and answer to a security question. Upon successful registration, users are redirected to the login page.

### User Login Page
The user login page enables registered users to log into their accounts. Users must provide their email and password to authenticate. After successful login, users are redirected to their intended destination or the homepage.

### Forgot Password 
The forgot password page lets users reset their passwords. Users enter their registered email, answer a security question, and provide a new password. This process helps users regain access to their accounts in case they forget their password.

### Cart Page
The cart page displays the items that users have added to their cart. Users can view product details, remove items, and proceed to checkout. If the user is logged in, they can also make a payment using the Braintree payment gateway. The page calculates and displays the total price of the items in the cart.
